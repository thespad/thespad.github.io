Long ago, in the long-distant mists of time, I ran my blog on Wordpress. When I moved off it to Ghost a few years back it was frankly way too much effort to try and bring all the posts with me and maintain their URLs so I just left the old site up. However, as you [may have seen](https://gizmodo.com/wordpress-tumblr-plan-sell-user-content-ai-companies-1851291225), it looks like Automattic are going to start selling user data to AI companies for training their models on an opt-*OUT* basis and, even though I'm self-hosting, as I'm using plugins like Jetpack I don't trust them not to harvest everything I've written to sell for their own benefit.

So, making use of [https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter), I have pulled all the important posts out of my old site and imported them here, with what is hopefully a working redirect from the old URLs.

Just in case you're wondering where all the old posts suddenly appeared from.
