This handy little script will pull all of the users from the specified AD group and then grab the LastLogon time from each specified DC (or you could use`[DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().DomainControllers` to get all of them in the current domain) as well as grabbing the LastLogonTimeStamp for good measure. You can also specify which attribute you want to sort the results on; I recommend `samaccountname` because it's usually the most useful.

Obviously it's much quicker and simpler to do this with the ActiveDirectory cmdlets, but sometimes you're stuck working with a bunch of 2003 DCs and have to make do with ADSI.
